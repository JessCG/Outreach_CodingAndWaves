To instructor:
- Once this script has been modified to include the reference image, it is best to close it and simply run it from the R Console by typing source(“ProcessingWaveTankData.R”) to avoid modifying it when input are required in the console. It is easy to have the cursor in the wrong place.
- Click ‘Zoom’ in RStudio to help see the wave if screens are small
