# Outreach_CodingAndWaves
Activities developed to introduce middle or high school students to programming,
as well as data analysis and oceanography, using an example with waves generated 
in the Scripps Institution of Oceanography's wave tank.'

Instructors, teachers or students wanting to use these activities are encouraged 
to read Coding Activities - Instructor Information. Very little to no prior 
knowledge of R is assumed, but troubleshooting various issues will become 
easier with experience. Lines starting with # are comments, text colors have 
meaning, and exact syntax is crucial. Typos are usually responsible for most 
errors when starting.

General Instructions for Coding Activities apply to every activity and can be 
printed once for each group of students.

Code was developed by Jessica C. Garwood (jgarwood@ucsd.edu) - efforts were 
made to respect best coding standards :)

Many thanks to Helen Yip from the Ocean Discovery Institute in San Diego for her 
valuable feedback and being the motivation behind this outreach, as well as Nick 
Pizzo, Bia Villas Boas, and Derek J Grimes from the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography (UCSD) for generating the data.
