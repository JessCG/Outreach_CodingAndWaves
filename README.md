# Outreach_CodingAndWaves
Activities developed to introduce middle or high school students to programming,
as well as data analysis and oceanography, using an example with waves generated 
in the Scripps Institution of Oceanography's wave tank. You will need to download 
R and RStudio, both are free.

For those not familiar with GitHub, the best way to get started with this 
material is to navigate to the Outreach_CodingAndWaves folder, then click on the 
green button "Clone or download" to the right of the screen, then "Download ZIP". 
This will download all the files and folders to your computer. The zipped package 
is ~310 MB and will take a few minutes to download.

Instructors, teachers or students wanting to use the activities provided are 
encouraged to read Coding Activities - Instructor Information. Very little to no 
prior knowledge of R is assumed, but troubleshooting various issues will become 
easier with experience. Lines starting with # are comments, text colors have 
meaning, and exact syntax is crucial. Typos or being in the wrong directory are 
usually responsible for most errors when starting.

General Instructions for Coding Activities apply to every activity and can be 
printed once for each group of students. Some activities include Powerpoint 
presentations that were created by Helen Yip to guide students through the 
activities. A final presentation given by students at the Ocean Discovery 
Institute is also included. 

Code was developed by Jessica C. Garwood (jgarwood@ucsd.edu) - efforts were 
made to respect best coding standards, but you may find exceptions :)

Many thanks to Helen Yip from the Ocean Discovery Institute in San Diego for her 
valuable feedback and for being the motivation behind this outreach, as well as 
Derek J Grimes, Stephen Holleman, Nick Pizzo, and Bia Villas Boas, from the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UCSD) for wave tank demos and generating 
the data.
